# Anilist Month List
Just wanted to check how many animes I watched in past 2 months XD. And also wanted to give `Deno` a try...


## Usage
### Prerequisite
 - [Deno](https://deno.land)

Just clone this project and run 
```sh
deno run --allow-net index.ts --username piyushsthr
```

In case you want to compile it...
```sh 
deno compile --allow-net index.ts
```
This will give you `anilist-month-list.exe` or according to your system...
